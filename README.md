# 2048
Classic 2048 game.
Written in Qt, however, features like QML were not used here, so cells movings aren't smooth. User is able to change the game field size, redo game state. Application also saves best score in .dat file and loads it in a new game. I've tried to provide some extensibility, so some elements are developed on the interface level.
